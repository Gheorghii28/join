                <h2>What is Join?</h2>
                <p>
                    Join is a project management methodology that originated in the manufacturing industry and has
                    since been adopted in various fields, including software development, product management, and other
                    knowledge-based projects.

                    At its core, Join is focused on visualizing work and workflow to improve efficiency, productivity,
                    and collaboration within a team. It uses a visual board, often divided into columns, to represent
                    different stages of work. Tasks or work items are represented by cards or sticky notes, which are
                    moved across the board as they progress through the workflow.
                </p>

            <h2>How to use it</h2>
            <div id="help-text-2">
                <div>
                    <span>1.</span>
                    <p>
                        Visualize the workflow: Create a visual representation of the work stages, typically using a
                        Join board, to provide a clear overview of the tasks and their progress.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <span>2.</span>
                    <p>
                        Limit work in progress (WIP): Set explicit limits on the number of tasks that can be in progress
                        simultaneously. This helps prevent overloading the team and promotes a focus on completing work
                        before starting new tasks.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <span>3.</span>
                    <p>
                        Manage flow: Aim to have a smooth and continuous flow of work through the system, avoiding
                        bottlenecks and minimizing delays.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <span>4.</span>
                    <p>
                        Make policies explicit: Clearly define the rules, policies, and criteria for moving tasks
                        through different stages. This ensures transparency and consistency in the workflow.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <span>5.</span>
                    <p>
                        Continuously improve: Encourage ongoing reflection, analysis, and optimization of the workflow
                        and processes to achieve higher efficiency and quality.
